1) Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.

Running the `sort` command on commands.js returns each line in the file sorted alphabetically.

`wc commands.js` returns the number of lines, words, and characters in the file: `49 127 1194 commands.js`

`uniq commands.js` returns every line in the file, since there are no repeated lines in `commands.js`.

2) Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain
what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

cat bash.js commands.js | wc

The command on the left of the pipe concatenates bash.js with commands.js,
and this becomes the standard input of the word count command on the right.

The output is then:
  80     241    2141

Calling the word count command on commands.js alone returns:
  69     197    1775

6) Given a string, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while
 maintaining the original word order and whitespace and return the string. 

function reverseString(inputString) {
  //set reversedInput to empty array
  let reversedInput = [];
  //set stringsArray to array of substrings on " ";
  let stringsArray = inputString.split(" ");
  //for each element in array
  stringsArray.forEach(element => {
    reversedInput.push(element.split("").reverse().join(""));
  });
  let finalReversedString = reversedInput.join(" ");
  return finalReversedString;
};

let test = "I'm learning to program algorithms!"
reverseString(test);
